A website which calculates an album's tracklist and timestamps from uploaded user files, and prints the results in a user-friendly readable format like such:

Tracklist:

```text

    (10:21) 03 - Savannah
    (14:55) 04 - Canyon
    (20:26) 05 - Orange Valley
    (25:28) 06 - Sand-Dunes
    (28:35) 08 - Swamps
```
